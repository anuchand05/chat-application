# Quantum Secure Chat Application


Overview

This is a secure chat application that integrates Quantum Cryptography techniques to ensure end-to-end encrypted communication. It leverages the BB84 protocol for Quantum Key Distribution (QKD), Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) for message encryption, and classical cryptographic techniques for secure key exchange and authentication.

Key Features  
 
Quantum Key Distribution (QKD): Uses the BB84 protocol to securely exchange encryption keys, ensuring protection against eavesdropping. 
AES Encryption: Implements AES-256 for encrypting and decrypting messages using the quantum-generated key.
Authentication & Integrity: Ensures secure authentication between users to prevent impersonation.
End-to-End Security: The combination of QKD and AES guarantees a highly secure communication channel.
Resilience Against Quantum Attacks: Unlike traditional encryption methods, this approach is future-proof against quantum computing threats.
